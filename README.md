# 4D-Visualization-of-Complex-Function
Interactive visualization of complex function w = f(z), plotted in 4-dimensional space

# Explanation
The colors on the graph are used to indicate the depth information of the graph in the 4th dimension (w-axis). You may use this to assist you in building the intuitive feeling for the graph in 4D space in your mind.

You can watch the 2 graph simutaneously by parallel-eyes viewing to gain stereoscopic vision.
